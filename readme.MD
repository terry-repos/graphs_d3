# Graphs D3
Explores hierarchical containment and connectivity graphs using D3, populated with example biological datasets.
See http://graphs-0.appspot.com
All raw data can be found in /raw and all graph ready data can be found in /dat

## Bond graph (BG) example
The sample datasets include "BG" -- an elementary 3 neuron example that is depicted with bond graph formalism. These are overlaid on an anatomical "flatmap".
Regions under the SVG can be dragged and the nodes will be centered on the correspondingly housed region of the SVG. Clicking on a region or a node will zoom to the region / node.

## ApiNATOMY Spinothalamic / Gracile Tract data example
This ApiNATOMY dataset was used as an example dataset for exploring the ApiNATOMY data model and graphing nervous system tracts. See the ApiNATOMY Lyph Viewer that includes more data and includes visual components of ApiNATOMY lyphs, layers and topology in the graphs (https://github.com/open-physiology/open-physiology-viewer).

## Swanson rat nervous system example
The Swanson datasets that were obtained provide a wealth of containment data for the rat nervous system, connectivity data is far more sparse and is 'protected' under password. Connectivity data available can be found under the "CNS regions" dataset.

Raw data can be found in /raw/swanson and was obtained from these publications
* "Network architecture of the Cerebral Nuclei" - 2016
* "Organizing principles for Cerebral Cortex network commissural association connections" - 2017
* "Brain maps 4 - Structure of the rat brain - An open access atlas" - 2018
